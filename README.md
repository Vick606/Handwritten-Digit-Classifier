# Handwritten Digit Classifier

## Overview
This project builds a **neural network** using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0â€“9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the digit in a given image.

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: MNIST (70,000 images, 60,000 for training, 10,000 for testing).
- **Model**: A simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.
- **Visualizations**: Training/validation accuracy and loss curves, sample predictions.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Data preprocessing, neural network design, model evaluation, and visualization.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x 
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
